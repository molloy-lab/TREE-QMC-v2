"This is version 2.0.0 of TREe Embedded Quartet Max Cut (TREE-QMC).\n\n"

"OPTIONS:\n"
"[-h|--help]\n"
"        Prints this help message.\n"
"(-i|--input) <input file>\n"
"        Name of file containing gene trees in newick format (required)\n"
"        IMPORTANT: current implementation of TREE-QMC requires that the input\n"
"        gene trees are unrooted and binary. Thus, TREE-QMC suppresses roots\n" 
"        and randomly refines polytomies during a preprocessing phase; the\n"
"        resulting trees are written to \"<input file>.refined\".\n"
"[(-o|--output) <output file>]\n"
"        Name of file for writing output species tree (default: stdout)\n"
"[(--polyseed) <integer>]\n"
"        Seeds random number generator with <integer> prior to arbitrarily\n"
"        resolving polytomies. If <integer> is set to -1, system time is used;\n" 
"        otherwise, <integer> should be positive (default: 12345).\n"
"[(--maxcutseed) <integer>]\n"
"        Seeds random number generator with <integer> prior to calling the max\n"
"        cut heuristic but after the preprocessing phase. If <integer> is set to\n"
"        -1, system time is used; otherwise, <integer> should be positive\n"
"        (default: 1).\n"
"[(-n|--normalize) <normalization scheme>]\n"
"        Initially, each quartet is weighted by the number of input gene\n"
"        trees that induce it. At each step in the divide phase of wQMC and\n"
"        TREE-QMC, the input quartets are modified with artificial taxa. We\n"
"        introduce two normalization schemes for artificial taxa and find\n"
"        that they improve empirical performance of TREE-QMC in a simulation\n"
"        study. The best scheme is run by default. See paper for details.\n"

"        -n 1: uniform\n"
"        -n 2: non-uniform (default)\n"
"[(-x|--execution) <execution mode>]\n"
"        TREE-QMC uses an efficient algorithm that operates directly on the\n"
"        input gene trees by default. The naive algorithm, which operates on a\n"
"        set of quartets weighted based on the input gene trees, is also\n"
"        implemented for testing purposes.\n"
"        -x 0: run efficient algorithm (default)\n"
